#Blink

It is a api that uses node js and mongo db . It is still in active development .I built it to play music in a local network . 
It is the backend of music player which I will build . You can create your own spotify like service which will be ad free and completely private .  I ignored security in this project because it will be on my home server and I made it to be on home servers
accessible locally .
