#VAF API 
(Vulnerable as Fuck)

It is a api that uses node js and mongo db . It is still in active development .I built it to play music in a local network . 
It is the backend of music player which I will build . You can create your own spotify like service which will be ad free and completely private
Never expose this to the internet as this api is probably vulnerable to nosql injections . I did not sanitize the data which goes into the the db as I wanted to try some nosql injections . I will make the api more secure in future versions after having some fun
Before starting you need to go to line 140 to change path
